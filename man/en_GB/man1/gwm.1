.SH NAME
.B
gwm \- gwm (gsm's window manager), is an X11-based dynamic window manager written in C language.
.
.SH SYNOPSIS 
.B gwm
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
gwm (gsm's window manager), is an X11-based dynamic window manager written in C language.
.PP
The child windows of the X Window System are always located above the parent window in screen space, and the window opened later is always located above the brother window opened first in screen space; the newly opened window is always located on top of the screen space. This window order is called window stacking order. The stacking order can be adjusted.
.PP
gwm virtualizes the physical screen into multiple logical screens, the so-called virtual desktops. Logically, for each virtual desktop, the screen space above root window is divided into the following seven layers from bottom to top: desktop layer, below layer, tile layer, dock layer, above layer, full screen window layer; The screen is divided into taskbar and workarea from the plane. Among them, the workarea of the tile layer is divided into main area, second area, and fixed area. This is just a logical layering, the purpose is to achieve visual layering. In fact, gwm achieves the layering effect by adjusting the stacking order of the windows, not by resetting the parent window for layering. A window on the upper layer will always block the window on the lower layer. gwm supports four window layout modes: tiling, stacking, and preview, which can be dynamically switched at runtime. The taskbar is consists of buttons on the left, a icon bar in the middle, and a status bar on the right. Buttons are used to achieve specific functions, and the text of each button from left to right is: 1, 2, 3, □, ▦, ▣, ▥, ■, ^. The icon bar is used to display the iconified window, click the iconified window to deiconify window. The status bar shows the name of the root window.
.PP
The windows mentioned below, unless otherwise specified, refer to the windows managed by this window manager. The current window mentioned below, unless otherwise specified, refer to the window under the current virtual desktop that is located at the top of the layer to which the window belongs and has the keyboard input focus. The following instructions or commands, unless otherwise specified, are limited to the current virtual desktop.
.PP
Tiling mode is a layout mode in which all normal windows are arranged proportionally in the workarea of the tile layer. It divides the screen space into main area, secondary area, fixed area from left to right. If the fixed area is not occupied by windows, the area will be merged into the main area and the secondary area. If the secondary area is not occupied by a window, the area is merged into the main area. Each of the three areas evenly allocates space to the corresponding window. The windows of the main area and the secondary area are complementary to each other, that is, if the number of windows in the main area is more than the number of windows that can be accommodated in the main area due to an operation, the windows at the bottom of the main area will be moved to the top of the secondary area; If the number of windows in the main area is less than the number of windows that can be accommodated in the main area and the number of windows in the secondary area is greater than zero, the window at the top of the secondary area will be moved to the bottom of the main area. Hereinafter, this rule is referred to as main and secondary area complementarity.
.PP
Stacking mode is a layout mode in which windows can be stacked, and all normal windows are arranged in the workarea according to their requested positions.
.PP
Preview mode is a layout mode in which all windows equally distribute workarea space. If a window is selected in this mode, it will switch to the previous layout mode, the selected window will become the current window, and other windows will remain in the previous layout mode. If the previous layout mode is tiling mode, the selected window will be moved to the top of the main area.
.PP
gwm resets the parent window for all windows, the parent window also includes the border, the title bar, both of which are collectively called the window frame. The original window range before reparenting is called the non-frame area. Among them, the title bar sets the title area and buttons sequentially from left to right. The title area is used to display the title of the window and provide the function of moving the window. Buttons are used to implement specific functions, and the number of buttons varies with the basic window layout mode. In tiling mode, the text of each button from left to right is: ◁, ▼, ▷, △, —, □, ×. In stacking mode, ◁, ▼, ▷, △ buttons are not displayed. In preview mode, only the × button is displayed.

.SH USAGE
.
.SS General Description
.
.TP
You can view the mapping of modifier keys through xmodmap(1). Usually, Mod1 corresponds to Alt, and Mod4 corresponds to Super.
.TP
When using keyboard commands, pointer commands, the caps lock and num lock keys are ignored.
.TP
When moving or resizing a window in tiling mode, the window switches to the top of the float layer, while the remaining windows remain in the original layout mode. Windows can only be moved or resized in stacking, or tiling modes. Except that the window can be iconified in the stacking mode, only in the tiling mode can the place be swapped or changed for the window, the area ratio can be adjusted, and the maximum number of windows in the area can be adjusted. When a window is moved or resized, a hint window for window coordinates and dimensions will be displayed. The size is in the size step value preferred by the program, which may be in pixels, character width, or other.
.TP
Window group refer to all open windows of the same program, while a window subgroup refer to a program's main window and all its descendant transient windows. If the window subgroup contains modal windows, only the top-level modal window can be operated. When performing operations of iconify, deiconify, and desktop switching on a window, the same operation will be performed on other windows in the same subgroup; when performing other operations, it will only be applied to this window.
.TP
When there is an urgency or attention request come from a client window which not on the current virtual desktop, the taskbar desktop button corresponding to the virtual desktop where the client window is on will change color. Usually red represents an urgency request and yellow represents a attention request. Specific colors vary by color theme.
.TP
Unless otherwise specified, the following commands operate on the current desktop.
.TP
The status bar will show the result of "xsetroot \-name". If not set, "gwm" is displayed.
.TP
Immediately after gwm starts, it tries to execute ~/.config/gwm/autostart.sh.

.SS Pointer Command
.
.TP
Pointer hovering means that the pointer does not move for a set period of time. Pointer button 1 is usually the left mouse button, pointer button 2 is usually the middle mouse button, and pointer button 3 is usually the right mouse button. Clicking on the window with the pointer will switch the window to the current window. Clicking in a window other than the Action Center will close the Action Center. Pointer commands vary by pointer button pressed, keypressed, clicked, window hovered over. Unless otherwise specified below, when the pointer hovers over the component, a tooltip window will pop up.
.
.TP
Unless otherwise specified below, moving the window refers to moving the window from the place where the window is clicked to the place where the corresponding pointer button is released. If this operation is performed in the tiling mode, the window will also move to float layer; swapping the window refers to in the tiling mode, the clicked window is swapped with the window where the cursor is when the corresponding pointer button is released; changing place refers to change the clicked window to the place indicated by the clicked place button, or change the clicked window to the place where the cursor was when the corresponding pointer button was released and is placed in front of the window where the cursor was released, with the following exceptions: When released at the left edge of the screen, if a window exists in the secondary area, the window change to the top of the secondary area, Otherwise, change to the top of the main area; when the right edge of the screen is released, change to the top of the fixed area; when the root window is released, change to the top of the main area.
